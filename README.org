* Prolog Language server

Still a heavy work-in-progress.

Currently supports showing documentation on hover, go to definition, go to callers, and listing defined symbols in the file.

Only tested with SWI-Prolog, as it heavily uses its introspection facilities to do its stuff.
It should work with any relative-recent versions of SWI-Prolog, but for best results for "find references" in particular, use a version with ~xref_called/5~ (as of this writing, currently unreleased; past commit [[https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/commit/303f6430de5c9d7e225d8eb6fb8bb8b59e7c5f8f][303f6430de5c]]).

To use with Emacs, via [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq prolog-lsp-server-path (expand-file-name "~/Projects/prolog-lsp/prolog/server.pl"))

(lsp-register-client
 (make-lsp-client
   :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection (list "swipl"
                                               "-s" prolog-lsp-server-path
                                               "-g" "main" "-t" "halt"
                                               "--" "stdio"))
   :major-modes '(prolog-mode)
   :priority 1
   :multi-root t
   :server-id 'prolog-ls))
#+end_src
