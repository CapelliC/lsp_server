* Prolog Language server

Still a heavy work-in-progress.

To use with Emacs, via [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(lsp-register-client
 (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection (list "swipl"
                                                              "-s" "~/Projects/prolog-lsp/prolog/server.pl" "-g" "main" "-t" "halt" "--" "stdio"))
                  :major-modes '(prolog-mode)
                  :priority 1
                  :multi-root t
                  :server-id 'prolog-ls))
#+end_src
